# Urban Planning Model Development

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing urban planning efforts in Asian countries by developing a predictive model based on a comprehensive dataset of building topology, passive features, and building types. Our goal is to provide insights that can assist in sustainable urban development and effective resource allocation.

## Contribution

I contributed to this project by annotating a complete dataset that includes various attributes of buildings, such as:
- **Building Topology**: Structural layout and design features.
- **Passive Features**: Energy efficiency aspects, including insulation and orientation.
- **Building Types**: Classification of buildings based on their usage (residential, commercial, etc.).

The annotated dataset plays a critical role in training the predictive model, which aims to aid urban planners in making data-driven decisions for future developments.

## Features

- Comprehensive annotation of building datasets.
- Enhanced model accuracy for urban planning applications.
- Focus on sustainability and efficient resource management in Asian cities.
